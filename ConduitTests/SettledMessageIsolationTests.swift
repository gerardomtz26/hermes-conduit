/// What this suite asserts: the gate's input contract at value level
/// (`testEquatableConformanceComparesEveryGateInput` — every Equality field,
/// including both environment-derived inputs), that a content, resolver or
/// Dynamic Type change still OPENS the gate and re-renders
/// (`testContentChange…`, `testResolverChange…`,
/// `testDynamicTypeChange…`), and that ancestry environment churn cannot
/// re-open a pinned row (`testWindowTraitChurnDoesNotReopenSettledGate`, the
/// build-147 churn vector, with an unpinned canary proving the churn reached
/// the hierarchy).
///
/// What this suite deliberately does NOT assert: dormancy itself. On a cold
/// erased device (2026-09-22, this suite run alone in the exact composition
/// hosted CI runs), a settled row hosted on its own re-evaluates its Markdown
/// once per unrelated publish while the gate comparison is not reached at all
/// in a majority of runs — the hosting graph re-runs the row's
/// dynamic-property body. That is a property of hosting a settled row outside
/// a transcript, and it is invariant to the shape (hosting root, ForEach child
/// of a LazyVStack in a ScrollView, environment pin above or below the row).
/// The dormancy invariant is therefore asserted where production exercises it:
/// TranscriptPerformanceFixtureTests, over a 10-tick streaming window in the
/// real transcript shape, with per-position classification and bounded
/// per-tick work.
